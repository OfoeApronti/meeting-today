# Questions
These are influenced by the **Dimensions** section of my Job Description

- Concerning the extended working hours and holiday work contributions, can tasks be performed remotely

- For monitoring and analyzing the performance and throughput, does the institution support the use of open-source tools such as Prometheus, ElasticSearch, Kibana and Grafana, Kafka

- What are test processes currently existing, are they automated or manual.

- For automation of repetitive workflow,test, and implementation(debugging, integration, testing, and test reporting and documentaion) does the institution support the use of automation tools(Selenium, puppeteer) and CI/CD tools(Github or TravisCI)

- I expect to use Artificial Intelligence(A.I) service subscription to build automation bot. Is your institution open to subscribe to A.I.  frameworks(DialogFlow(Google), Watson(IBM), or MS Bot framework)

- **Training**
To be effective and innovative and continuously deliver value, I may need to subscribe to some knowledge portals that may not be among the learning HR portals(Udemy, Coursera, Safaribooksonline). Is the institution willing to provide access to these knowledge sites.

# Key Result Areas
I respectfully suggest that, the **key result areas** recognize the automation of any repetitive. Automation takes a considerable investment in time and skill
