I am a dedicated and amiable technology person

I joined Fidelity Asset Management right from university, 2007. I impressed my actuarial science lecturer, who was also the Manager for Fidelity Asset Management. 
To do so, I used a weekend to flesh a basic pension reporting software, and he immediately run to convince Jim i was the missing piece in his team.
Whilst there, I was tasked to automate the processes there, which were
- Investment flow
- Pension Administration

I delivered two enterprise application namely Imatrix, and Istaff. The software run for over 10yrs, and managed over ghc100million worth of investment

 
I transitioned to Fidelity Bank (Ghana) in 2010 as the Business Solutions Officer. My support function included supporting the core banking application, building documentation for users to close the knowledge gap, identifying bugs and working out a solution wiht Oracle etc. 

Besides the volume of work involved in supporting a core banking, I siezed the initiative and developed applications that made our internal customers deliver better value and maximize use of their time.
 
I transitioned to the IBM AMS team(Feb, 2015) providing service delivery and digital transformation to Fidelity Bank Ghana. I delivered a number of key automation services to the bank, and I was recognized by IBM for my technical contribution with the Wild Duck Award(MEA). 
Of relevance was the deployment of the first A.I. powered help desk assistant in Africa for Fidelity Bank. The agent engaged users on their issues, attempted to solve level1 issues and then log tickets on the user's behalf. It was further upgraded to help users with account unlock and password resets. 

Other notable contribution to Fidelity that is still in use are;
- BatchBois, the system that ensures Instant VISA cards worked flawlessly upon issuance.
- Flexkit, a handy account validation tool for Card, Trade, and Clearing team
- Flip calculator

For the core support team, I contributed the following solutions which are still in use today;
- Weblogic search. A handy interface to search for specific events in the weblogic 
- Newgen Stabilizaer. A low level utility that analyses logs and takes corrective action to prevent Newgen meltdown
- Highly customizable Backup utility for most of the Bank's applications

I am known to be a dependable team member that goes out of my way to help solve very challenging issue. {Tell a story about Dublin telecom]

I evolved within IBM to another role, client technical lead for Ghana. I essentially engaged clients on their technology strategy and then offered IBM solutions that assisted with that strategy. I also delivered technical presentation and demonstration on cloud, hybrid cloud, A.I. etc.
Most of our clients are banks, and so i witnessed the resources banks were commiting towards improving their services, getting ready for cloud automation and also exploring ways of using A.I to mine value from the data they had accumulated over the years. 


I further transitioned to the IBM Corporate Intelligence as a developer/ data specialist. I use industry best practices processes to deliver cloud solutions that safeguard IBM highvalued clients and intellectual assets.

It involves upgrading API and processing eg. transforming 'XML' API into context aware Graphql queries for consumption by anciliary applications. Among other things using CI/DI pipelines to enable deployment to cloud kubernetes environments(Openshift) 

As you can see, my career journey started with Fidelity, and i recall in 2015 when we were reluctant to join IBM, Mr. Effah told us, "As IT professionals, we can be the best versions of ourselves within a global technology firm". I think i embody those words

In conclusion, I am a dependable, highly skilled, super motivated one man army. 
I also possess a particular set of qualities that makes everyone motivated and bouyant.
